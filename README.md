**WordPress Plugin ip2location-country-blocker v 2.19.1 quick fix by Amirhosseinhpv**

Hello everyone, i just updated to 2.19.1 and noticed it prints out index.php in every single post and i cannot see any archive pages. so i checked the source and found the problem. in the main plugin file (ip2location-country-blocker.php) go to line 1823 and comment this line :

`echo $GLOBALS['pagenow'];`

by adding <strong>//</strong> at the beginning of line ~>

`//echo $GLOBALS['pagenow'];`

see the image 👇🏻

<img src="img.jpg" />

It'll fix the issue.
